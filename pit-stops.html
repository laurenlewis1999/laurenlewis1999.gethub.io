    <p> The Gallery Cafe offers a variety of food and drink options. All of their sandwiches are named after different artists, and their food is even served up to you on a painters pallete. I would recommend trying one of their maple donuts, they taste french toast and they are amazing! Each month they also freature the work of a local artist. The Gallery Cafe is the kind of place were you drink an ice coffee and write your novel.  </p>
    
    <h1> Bourgeois Cafe</h1>

    <p> The Bourgeois Cafe is a antique store meets coffee shop. The mismatched items give this place a cozy feel. Like the Gallery Cafe, they name their sandwitches after book titles, such as The Tail of Two Turkeys. </p>
