    <a href="https://devildawgs.com/"> Devil Dawgs</a>
    <p> Devil Dawgs has a handful of locations located around the city of Chicago. Devil Dawgs has also become a staple food for college students at DePaul. Their creative hotdog and hamburger combos attract people from all over the city. They even go as putting <b>peanut butter</b> on a hamburger. There is something for everyone here! You should also most definitly grab a milk shake while you are there. They are very rich, but tasty!</p>

    <a href="http://vitoandnicks.com/index.php"> Vito and Nick's</a>
    <p> Vito and Nick's is the exact place I think of when I think of a dive joint in Chicago. If you are looking for Chicago style pizza, Vito and Nick's is not the place for you. They take a less traditional path for and have almost paper thin pizza. The location on 84th and Pulaski, located on the southern part of Chicago, has been open since 1965. It is a local joint, you can tell its a place that has many stories to tell and plenty of pizzas to try. </p>
