    <p> Ann Sather is an iconic breakfast stop. The original store location is located at 909 W Belmont Ave, Chicago, IL 60657. The reason I have chosen them as a Sweet Spot is because of their decident cinnamon rolls. They are the best cinnamon rolls I have eaten in my entire life. You can get this sweet treat as side for your breakfast and lunch or you can stop by the front counter and pick one up before work. Stop by Ann Sathers for the amazing staff as well as an even more amazing cinnamon roll!</p>

    <p> Mario's Italian Ice is the perfect treat for a hot summer day. Mairo's is a long standing walkup dessert stand that serves a variety of flavors of Italian ice. The open May 1st, no promises it will be warm enough that day, but they are open! Mairo's is a perfect spot to grab a quick icey treat to cool off and also a great spot for an Instagram photo. They are the perfect combonation between sweet and tart, and there are real chunks of fruit in ever bite! Mario's is located at 1068 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60607. It is a must try if you are in the area!  </p>
